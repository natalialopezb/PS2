README

The following folder contains all the files used in the solution of PS2.

PS21.m contains the matlab code used to generate the solution of part 1 of the homework and PS22.m contains the matlab code for part 2.

To generate the solution to part 2, run PS22.m making sure that sys.m and sys2.m are in the same folder. sys.m defines the system of differential equations for the complete circuit and sys2.m for the broken circuit. All parameters are defined in the first part of the code and were obtained from Bionumbers unless stated otherwise in the code.

PS2_solutions contains the results and analysis to the problem set.
